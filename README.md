# Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch) -- Sebastian Raschka

This repository contains my learning notes and code implementations while studying Sebastian Raschka's book "Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)". The goal is to share my understanding and practical implementations with the community, making the journey of learning LLMs more accessible to others.


üìö About This Repository
This is a learning-focused repository where I document my journey through implementing and understanding Large Language Models from the ground up. While the original book serves as the primary reference, this repository represents my personal understanding, additional research, and hands-on implementations.

üéØ Repository Goals
- Document clear, well-commented implementations of LLM concepts
- Share detailed explanations of key concepts and architectural decisions
- Provide practical examples and use cases
- Create a resource that helps others learn LLM fundamentals
- Build a collaborative learning environment through community contributions

üìù Notes

- This is a learning repository, and implementations might not be production-ready
- All code is provided for educational purposes
- Feedback and suggestions are highly appreciated
- Content is continuously updated as I progress through the book
